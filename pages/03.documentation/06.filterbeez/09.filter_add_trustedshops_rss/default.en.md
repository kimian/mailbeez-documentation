Automatically add your store’s Trustedshops reviews into any MailBeez email campaign with the Add Trust Pilot Filter, part of the [Trustedshops Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustedshops_rss_importer/ "Trustedshops Integration Suite"); perfect for spicing up the [Winback](/documentation/mailbeez/winback_advanced/ "Winback Advanced Module") and [No Purchase](/documentation/mailbeez/nopurchase/ "Mailbeez No Purchase Modules") Mailbeez modules.


### Options:

**Number of ratings**  
 Number of ratings shown in emails (number)

**Minimum Stars**  
 Show only ratings with at least this number of stars (3-5)

**Shuffle Ratings**  
 Do you want to shuffle the ratings (True) or show only the latest ones (False)

### Usage

Install and activate this Module – you need to have the [Trustedshops Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_trustedshops_rss_importer/ "Trustedshops Integration Suite") configured.

By adding the following tags into your MailBeez templates you will be able to show a configured number of Trustedshops ratings in your MailBeez generated emails. You can place the tags wherever you want, so for example if you place them within your main template the ratings will be shown in all emails, but if you place them only in your content template, you are able control exactly in which emails the ratings will be visible:

Place this into the HTML-Version of your MailBeez template:

```
{$content.rss.trustedshops.html}
```

Place his into the TXT-Version of your MailBeez template:

```
{$content.rss.trustedshops.txt}
```

the template for displaying the ratings is taken from the RSS-Feed template files

```
rss_email_html.tpl  
rss_email_txt.tpl
```
located in

`mailhive\configbeez\config_trustedshops_rss_importer\templates`

More advanced users can also directly access the data object holding the ratings in the email template using following code example.


```
{assign var=feed_feed value=$data.feed.trustedshops}
{section name=item loop=$feed_feed}
  {$feed_feed[item].rating_stars}
  {$feed_feed[item].text}</br>
  {$feed_feed[item].user_deeplink}</br>
  {$feed_feed[item].date|date_format}
{/section}
```
